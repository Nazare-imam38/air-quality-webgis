# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed for Mapbox on Vercel

### 1. Updated Mapbox CDN Links
- Updated to latest stable version (v2.15.0)
- Added proper CORS attributes
- Added preconnect and preload for better performance

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling for Mapbox initialization
- Added fallback UI when Mapbox fails to load
- Added safety checks for all map-related functions

### 3. Vercel Configuration
- Added `vercel.json` with proper headers and security settings
- Added rewrite rules for SPA deployment

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Added preconnect to Mapbox CDN
- Added preload for critical resources
- Added proper meta tags for SEO

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**: Make sure all changes are committed and pushed to your repository

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect it's a static site
   - Deploy!

3. **Environment Variables** (if needed):
   - No environment variables required for this deployment
   - Mapbox token is hardcoded in the script (consider moving to env vars for production)

## Troubleshooting

If Mapbox still doesn't load:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for CORS or network errors
2. **Check Network Tab**: Verify Mapbox resources are loading
3. **Test Locally**: Run `python -m http.server` or similar to test locally
4. **Check Vercel Logs**: Look at function logs in Vercel dashboard
